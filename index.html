      <p> When I was a little girl I loved to cook, spending hours in the kitchen with my mother, making a mess but learning delicious recipes, using authentic, seasonal, fresh ingredients and preparing everything from scratch. Today, I am still that same little girl playing in the kitchen. I like to experiment with different tastes and textures to create my own personal recipes. Cooking, eating healthy food and staying active have always been my life-long passion and – indeed – way of life.</p>

            <h3>Sweet Potato Pizza</h3>
            <p id="recipe">This vegan, gluten-free sweet potato pizza crust is as nourishing as it is flavorful. Steamed sweet potatoes are mixed with oat flour, a bit of almond meal, a chia egg, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and a zesty array of spices. The crust puffs as it bakes and the seasonings create the most wonderful aroma. </p>
